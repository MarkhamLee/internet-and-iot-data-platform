# Python script for pulling data from a PMS5003 air quality sensor
# connected by USB, and then pushing the data to console.
# Influenced by R. Smith's script for the same sensor:
# https://github.com/rsmith-nl/ft232-pms5003/tree/main
# WIP - this iteration is to test pushing the containner to a device
# and then running it for several days to see if the measurements are
# consistent
